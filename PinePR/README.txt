PinePR is a simple launcher to get you to the WiFi Pineapple dashboard
without having to open your browser and enter the URL manually. This is
automated and optionally password protected.

VERSION:
BETA 1.1

NOTES:
Please note that, when you use the program for the first time
setting up (and not setting up) a password will be slow, just STRIKE THE ENTER
KEY CONTINUEOUSLY until main menu apears. This is due to the program saving the settings
to the configuration file.

INSTRUCTION:
=================
=================

Run "Setup-PinePR.exe"
Follow on screen instructions.
